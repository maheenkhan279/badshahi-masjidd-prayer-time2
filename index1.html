                <p>The Badshahi Masjid, or the Royal Mosque, is an iconic symbol of Mughal architecture located in <strong>Lahore, Pakistan</strong>. Commissioned by the <strong>Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671</strong>, it was completed in just two years and is renowned for its grand scale and intricate design. The mosque features a stunning red sandstone structure adorned with beautiful white marble inlays, reflecting the architectural prowess of the era. Capable of accommodating up to <strong>55,000 worshippers</strong>, it was the largest mosque in the world at the time of its completion. The mosque not only serves as a place of worship but also as a testament to the cultural and historical significance of the Mughal Empire, showcasing the artistry and engineering skills of its builders. </p>
